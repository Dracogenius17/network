The goal of this micro project is to study the relationship
between different graph properties. I will generate many forms of graphs, each with unique properties, and cluster graphs based connectivity, average path length, and degree
distribution.

The paper deals with types of network measurements. Indeed,
it is only by obtaining informative quantitative features of
the networks topology that they can be characterized and
analyzed and, particularly, their structure can be fully
related with the respective dynamics. Applying some
transformation to the network N and looking at the delta in
the vectorized representation of N and N', u and u'
respectively, can yield additional insight pertaining to the
properties of the original network. THIS IS NETWORK TRANSFORMATION
DELTA.

Graph properties:

 N(G)       	Set of vertices of graph G
 E(G)       	Set of M edges of graph G
w:E(G) -> R		Mapping of weights to edge7
 |X|			Cardinality of Set X or D(n)
  N 			Number of vertices |N(G)|
  M    			Edges, or |E(G)|
  W				Weight Matrix
  A				Adjacency Matrix
  a_{ij}		Element of the adjacency matrix
  k_{i} 		Degree of vertex N
  k^{out}_{i} 	Out-degree of vertex i
  k^{in}_{i}  	In-degree of vertex i
  v(i)			Set of neighbors of vertex i
||X|| 			ßSum of the elements of matrix X
δ_{T}(W) 		Threshholding operation on a weighted
				digraph, yielding adjacency matrix

The average degree of a network, represented by adjacency matrix A, is

	avgDeg(A) = sum(A)*1/N.

With a weighted network, it is

	avgDegWeighted(W) = sum(W)*1/N.



Two non-adjacent vertices can be connected through a sequence of m edges (i, k1), (k1, k2),...(km-1,j), forming set Z of all walks between edges;

	if (N_i,N_j) ∋ Z(G) ⋀ (N_j,N_h) ∋ Z(G)
	then Z(G) = Z(G) ∪ {(N_i,N_h)}.

If all vertices and edges along a path are distinct, it is considered a path. Otherwise, it is a loop.

One thing to think about is the different types of connectivity among neurons. See the paper Dissecting Functional Connectivity  of Neuronal Microcircuits: Experimental and Theoretical Insights.

- Anatomical Connectivity: monosynaptic path. Neuron A is anatomically linked to neuron B.
- Functional Conectivity: a statistical dependence between neuron A and B. The firing of B can be predicted by the firing of A.
- Effective Connectivity: a polysynaptic path between neurons. Test for this by perturbing the activity of one neuron and measuring the effect of that on other neurons.
