The goal of this micro project is to study the relationship between different graph properties. It will generate the necessary data and run the necessary analysis to cluster graphs based connectivity, average path length, and degree distribution.

The paper deals with types of network measurements. Indeed, it is only by obtaining informative quantitative features of the networks topology that they can be characterized and analyzed and, particularly, their structure can be fully related with the respective dynamics. Applying some transformation to the network N and looking at the delta in the vectorized representation of N and N', u and u' respectively, can yield additional insight pertaining to the properties of the original network. NETWORK TRANSFORMATION DELTA.

Graph properties:

N(G): Set of vertices of graph G
E(G): Set of M edges of graph G
w:E(G) -> R: Mapping of weights to edge
D(n): degree of node n
