    "The objective of this small notebook is to explore some of the concepts described in the paper [Characterization of Complex Networks: A Survey of measurements](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o8bvkbj07b8eifc/Network-Characterization.pdf?dl=0). By collecting data and analyzing it myself, I will start to gain an intuitive understanding of the relationships between different graph characteristics, learn how to use ipython, graphing, etc. I've learned that starting small is the first step to getting anywhere big. \n",
